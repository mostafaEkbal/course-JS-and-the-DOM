# Landing page
This project is for building an interactive Landing page.

## Project details
The project is about making a Landing page with four section and a nav-bar, and when you click on a selected section it scrolls you to the section and it adds a particular class when you scroll to it to highlight the section that you are on.

## The technologies i used to implement this project
I used the .getBoundingClientrect() method to know the location of every section, and then used the window.scroll() to scroll to the selected section.
For the class change on scroll i used the window.visualViewPort() with the .getBoundingClientrect() method to do it.
